// Initialize Number Variables
    Initialize myInteger as 6 (Amount of Arizona Iced Teas in a six-pack)
    Initialize myFloat as 0.99 (Cost of an Arizona Iced Tea)
    Initialize myDouble as 2.98 (Cost of a gallon jug of Arizona Iced Tea)

// Initialize Calculation Variables
    Initialize mySum as a float without a value
    Initialize myDifference as a float without a value
    Initialize myProduct as a float without a value
    Initialize myQuotient as a float without a value

// Initialize Edge Case Variables
    Initialize isFloatZero as a boolean set to false

// Check for Edge Cases
    If myFloat is equal to zero, 
    set isFloatZero to true

// Calculate Results
    mySum equals myInteger plus myFloat
    myDifference equals myInteger minus myFloat
    myProduct equals myInteger times myFloat

    // Only perform division operation if myFloat is not equal to zero
        If isFloatZero is equal to true, 
            then myQuotient equals myInteger divided by myFloat 

// Display results
    Print to console "Sum of myInteger and myFloat: " plus  mySum
    Print to console "Difference of myInteger and myFloat: " plus myDifference
    Print to console "Product of myInteger and myFloat: " plus myProduct

    // Only print the result of the quotient if myFloat is not equal to zero.
        If isFloatZero is equal to true, 
            then print to console "Division of myInteger and myFloat: " plus myQuotient
        Otherwise, print to console "myFloat is equal to zero, making it ineligible as a denominator"
