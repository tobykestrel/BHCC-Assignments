MAIN FUNCTION:
    Declare inputStream (ifstream).
    Declare outputStream (ofstream).
    Declare studentScores (vector of vectors of integers).
    Declare weightages (vector of integers).
    Declare courseParts (vector of strings).
    Declare studentNames (vector of strings).
    Declare fileName (string).
    Declare line (string).
    Declare amountOfStudents (integer).
    Ask the user for the fileName of the syllabus file containing the course parts and weightages.
    Get the fileName from the user's input.
    Call the function loadSyllabus(inputStream, fileName, weightages, courseParts).
    Ask the user how many students they have.
    While the user input is invalid (not a number or outside the range of 1-3):
        Let them know that it is an invalid input and ask for a valid input.
    For each student from 1 to the amountOfStudents:
        Open the student's score file using inputStream.
        If the file cannot be opened:
            Let the user know that the file could not be opened, and skip to the next student.
        Else:
            Let the user know that the student's score file is being analyzed.
            Get the student's name from the first line of the file.
            Remove any leading whitespaces from the name.
            Add the student's name to studentNames vector.
            For each line in the file:
                If the line is not empty:
                    Convert the line to an integer and add it to studentScores in the student's integer vector.
            Call the function gradeStudent(outputStream, studentScores[i], studentNames[i], weightages, courseParts).
            Let the user know that the student has been graded, and that their report has been made.
        Close the student's scores file.
    Pause the program before it can close with cin.get() so that the user can still view the console.

FUNCTION loadSyllabus(inputStream, fileName, weightages, courseParts):
    Open the syllabus file of fileName using inputStream.
    While file cannot be opened:
        Let the user know that the file could not be opened and ask for a valid fileName.
        Get fileName from user input.
        Open file using inputStream.
    Print that the file was opened successfully, and that the syllabus is being analyzed.
    For each line in the file:
        If the line is not empty:
            Find the position of the '%' character in the line.
            If no '%' character is found:
                Let the user know that the syllabus is not properly formatted, and that a % symbol is required.
                Exit the program.
            If a '%' character waws found:
                Extract the weightage percentage and add it to the weightages vector.
            Extract the course part title and add it to the courseParts vector.
    Close the syllabus file.
    Print the amount of course parts to let the user know.

FUNCTION gradeStudent(outputStream, studentScores, studentName, weightages, courseParts):
    Open a new file for the student, called [studentName].txt.
    Write the student's name at the top of the report.
    Declare double courseGrade = 0.
    For each course part:
        Calculate pointsEarned as (the course part's weightage / 100) * the student's score.
        Add pointsEarned to the courseGrade total.
        Write course part name, weightage, grade, and pointsEarned to the report.
    Write the final course grade.
    If the student's courseGrade >= 70: 
        Write that they passed the course.
    Otherwise: 
        Write that they failed the course.
    Close the student's report file.
