Do-while loop to ensure repeatability.
    Initialize a vector luckyTickets with ten hardcoded five-digit values.
    Initialize an empty vector winningTickets.
    Initialize boolean matchFound to false.
    For loop from 1 to 10:
        Prompt the user to enter winning number i.
        While input is invalid (not a number, not five-digits, or a duplicate):
            Prompt again for a valid number.
        Add the valid number to winningTickets.
    Bubble sort luckyTickets and winningTickets.
    For each number in luckyTickets:
        For each number in winningTickets:
            If the lucky number equals a winning number:
                Display the matching number.
                Set matchFound to true.
                Break out of the inner loop to begin checking the next lucky number.
    If no matches were found (matchFound is false):
        Print to the console that no matching ticket numbers were found.
    Ask the user if they want to run the program again (y/n).
