// Display a menu with the available operators.
    ================= Valid Operators =================
            Addition: +            Subtraction: -  
      Multiplication: *               Division: /  
              Modulo: %                                
    ===================================================

// Initialize Variables.
    Set operandOne, operandTwo, and solution to an undefined doubles.
    Set operation to an undefined character.

// Get user input for the operands.
    Ask the user what the first operand is.
    Assign input from the user to operandOne.
    If the input is not a valid number, tell the user and ask for the first operand again.
    Ask the user what the second operand is.
    Assign input from the user to operandTwo.
    If the input is not a valid number, tell the user and ask for the second operand again.

// Get user input for the operation.
    Ask the user what operation they want to perform.
    Assign input from the user to operation.
    If input is not one of the valid operators (+, -, *, /, %), tell the user and ask again.
    If the operation is division or modulo and the second operand is zero, tell the user and ask again.

// Calculate the solution based on the chosen operation.
    If operation is addition, then solution = operandOne + operandTwo.
    If operation is subtraction, then solution = operandOne - operandTwo.
    If operation is multiplication, then solution = operandOne * operandTwo.
    If operation is division, then solution = operandOne / operandTwo.
    If operation is modulo, then solution = operandOne - operandTwo * floor(operandOne / operandTwo).

// Display the solution.
    ==================== Solution ====================
        operandOne operation operandTwo = solution
    ==================================================

// Restart the program if the user wants to calculate again
    Ask if the user wants to calculate again.
    If input is not 'y', then close the program. Otherwise, restart the program.
