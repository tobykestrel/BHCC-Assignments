    - Print code banner.
    - Use a do-while loop to ensure repeatability:
        - Prompt the user to input a character (r, t, c, z).
        - Validate that the input is one of the four designated characters.
        - Use a while loop to repeeatedly ask for valid input if the input is invalid.
        - Use a switch case that checks the input character and performs accordingly:
            - 'r':

                - Validate that the input is a positive number.
                - Use a while loop to repeeatedly ask for valid input if the input is invalid.
                - Display that the area of a triangle with base (base) and height (height) is (call calculateTriangleArea() function).
            - 'c':
                - Display blurb explaining what's needed to calculate the area of a circle.
                - Prompt the user to input a radius.
                - Validate that the input is a positive number.
                - Use a while loop to repeeatedly ask for valid input if the input is invalid.
