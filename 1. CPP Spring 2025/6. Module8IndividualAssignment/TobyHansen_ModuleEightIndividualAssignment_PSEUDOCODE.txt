Use a do-while loop to run the program at least once. 
    Afterwards the conditional will check the user's input to see if it should run again.

Declare all of the variables that are going to be used in the program:
    Double: averageScore.
    Integer: highestScore, lowestScore, validScores, invalidScores, totalPoints, currentScore.
    String fileName.
    FileStream fileReaderWriter.

Validate the student_scores.txt file with a while loop.
    If it isn't valid, keep asking the user for a valid file name until it works.

Read every score from the student scores file using a while loop.
    If the score is invalid (not a number 0-100) then skip it and add 1 to invalidScores. Otherwise:
        Add the score to the totalPoints counted, and add 1 to the the totalScores counted.
        If it's higher than the current highestScore, make it the new highestScore.
        If it's lower than the current lowestScore, make it the new lowestScore.

Close the student scores file.

Validate the summary_report.txt file with a while loop.
    If it isn't valid, keep asking the user for a valid file name until it works.

Check that there were any valid scores with an if statement (if validScores is greater than zero).
If there were not any valid scores, a message letting the user know is written to the summary report file. 
There will also not be any valid scores if the file is empty. If there are valid scores however:
    Get the averageScore by dividing the totalPoints by the totalScores.
    Write to the summary report file:
        The total amount of valid scores (totalScores). 
        The total amount of invalid scores (invalidScores).
        The highest score (highestScore). 
        The lowest score (lowestScore).
        The average score (averageScore).

Close the summary report file.
