// Print the code banner before the code is run.

// Declare the variables used throughout the program.
    integer factorialInt = zero
    intefer factorialTotal = one

// Get input from the user to decide what number is facorialed.
(Any input greater than 31 won't work because of int limits).
    Prompt the user for a positive integer.
    Assign their input to factorialInt.
    Remove excess characters in the buffer.
    Use a while loop that checks if factorialInt is less than one. 
        If it is, then the input is invalid because non-integers return zero.
        Tell the user that there their input is invalid.
        Prompt them to enter a positive integer again.
        Assign their input to factorialInt.
        Remove excess characters in the buffer.

// Calculate the factorial and displays the answer.
    Print their factorial (ex. 5!).
    Use a while loop that stays true until broken out of.
        Multiply factorialTotal (which starts at one) by factorialInt.
        Print factorialInt, and then subtract one.
        If factorialInt is now zero then the factorial calculation is done.
            Print and equal sign and the answer.
            Break out of the while loop.
        If factorialInt is not now zero, then print a multiplication symbol (*).

// Restart the program if the user wants to calculate another factorial.
