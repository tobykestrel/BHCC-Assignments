Instructions:
Look at the attached file and at the end is a function to insert a node 
at a specific location. I am providing the code, what you need to do 
is write in English what the Data Structure for this function is.

Answer:
The data structure for this function is a singly linked list. All the nodes in the list store one piece of data and one pointer to the next node.
The function has three parameters: the head pointer of the list, the new node entry, and the specified position n in the list to insert it at.
The function works with the singly linked list by inserting a new node in one of three ways:
1. If the list is empty, it is inserted at the head.
2. If the specified position n is out of bounds of the list, it is inserted at the end of the list.
3. If the specified position n is a valid index, it is inserted as expected, now pointing to the node that was previously in the position.
